Hi, I am a current NYC Data Science Academy fellow with experience in capital markets and a passion for working on difficult problems. 
I spent the last three years as a proprietary trader, traveling the world and living in over 10 different countries. 
Previously I was an options market maker and equity trader at Susquehanna International Group, where I learned about 
the power of data-driven decision making in business and markets. 
I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Brown University and am excited to make data analytics a cornerstone of my career moving forward.
